# Module1challenge

## Overview of Project

Helping out Louise by providing her different insights into the the Kickstarter Campaign data. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to understand different functions and chart graphics in Excel in order to analyze the data
in a concise manner in order to make business decisions in the hopes of funding successful campaigns and understand which types failed. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Outcomes_based_on_launch_date 

The first view we looked into was the Theater Category and charted it over a 12-month timeframe to visualize what the Outcomes were.

Outcomes_Based_on_Goals 

The second view we looked into was how the subcategory plays and how their campaigns fared in their fundraising goals based on diffent ranges.

The challenges consisted of being able to calculate the different functions learned and ensuring that they were accurate and aligned
with expectations outlined throughout the modules. 

There were no glaring difficulties encountered. I had to play around with the VLOOOKUP criteria in order to accurately capture the Edinburgh Research columns. 

## Results

The first conclusion for the Outcomes_based_on_launch_data analysis that we found was that May and June had the highest number of successful Theater campaigns
and then they started to decline over the remaining months of the year. 

The second conclusion for the Outcomes_based_on_launch_data analysis was the canceled outcome remained flat over the 12-month timeframe and averaged roughly 3 per month. 

A conclusion found for the Outcomes_Based_on_Goals analysis was that the highest number of successful campaigns for plays was in the 1000 to 4999 range. 

One of the limitations of the dataset was what actually determined the outcomes criteria? Was is it number of tickets sold, positive media review, revenue generated? 

Some other types of tables and graphs we could have looked into were how many backers were associated with the specific outcomes?

More country specific analysis in understanding what outcomes were attributable to the different types of parent category/sub-category campaigns in those jurisdictions.
